# AGENTS.md

This file is the repository guide for AI-assisted coding in this workspace.
Follow it together with the higher-priority system/developer instructions.

## START HERE FOR FL AGENTS

- Read `fl://agent-briefing`, then `fl://status`, before selecting tools.
- Prefer current domain/workflow tools: `fl_transport`, `fl_mixer`,
  `fl_channel`, `fl_pattern`, `fl_playlist`, `fl_effect`, `fl_plugin`,
  `fl_piano_roll`, `fl_batch`, Project Health/Preflight, Mix Review, Routing
  Review, Project Organizer, audio analysis, MIDI export, and Knowledgebase
  tools.
- Check the Knowledgebase before FL state, mixer/plugin parameters, automation,
  REC events, or MIDI work. Do not guess ranges, mappings, indices, or IDs.
- No persistent FL write without rollback and readback:
  snapshot -> smallest write -> readback -> changelog -> rollback path.
- Stop when API support, readback, rollback, target selection, bridge status, or
  value evidence is unclear. Use read-only, dry-run, probe-only, or manual
  guidance instead.

## Mandatory First Reads

Before changing code, tests, docs, scripts, controller files, skill files, evals,
or roadmap state, read these files and follow them as binding project
instructions:

- `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`

If either file conflicts with an ad-hoc prompt, stop and surface the conflict
before implementing. The safety contract and roadmap scope are not optional.

## Working Mode

- Act as a senior, pragmatic software engineer.
- Inspect the repo before changing it. Read surrounding code, existing tool
  patterns, tests, safety layer, protocol constants, controller handlers, and
  registration style.
- For implementation work, explicitly inspect the relevant parts of
  `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/API_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md`,
  `src/fl_studio_mcp/safety.py`, `src/fl_studio_mcp/protocol.py`, the FL
  controller script, existing tool modules, and focused tests/scripts before
  editing.
- For non-trivial implementation slices, produce a short implementation plan
  before editing and confirm the slice is dependency-correct and rollback-safe.
- Before building anything new, check whether the functionality already exists
  under a different name or can be composed from existing safe primitives.
- Prefer existing project patterns over new abstractions.
- Use established patterns: protocol constants, controller handlers,
  `safety.safe_write`, `safety.safe_write_group`, Piano Roll safety helpers,
  focused tests/scripts, and FastMCP registration style.
- Keep edits small, coherent, and backport-friendly.
- Preserve all user and uncommitted changes. Never revert unrelated work.
- Use English for commits, code comments, docstrings, and repo documentation.

## Required Safety Posture

- No FL Studio project-state mutation may ship without rollback.
- Read-only actions are the only exception.
- Every persistent write must follow:
  scoped snapshot -> smallest practical write -> readback -> changelog entry ->
  rollback path.
- Multi-step changes must be one named rollback unit unless there is a clear,
  documented reason to split them.
- If API support, readback, or rollback is unclear, implement read-only,
  dry-run, manual-guidance, or probe-only behavior.
- Keep Piano Roll transforms undo-backed and explicit about readback limits.
- Normalize and Stretch Pro behavior remains probe-dependent; do not promise it.

## FL Studio Knowledgebase Protocol

- Agents MUST check the Knowledgebase (`knowledgebase/`) before making changes to FL Studio state, mixer parameters, plugin parameters, automation, REC events, or MIDI data.
- Agents MUST NOT guess valid value ranges, normalized values, dB/Hz mappings, REC event IDs, track indexing, or plugin parameter indices.
- Agents MUST prefer high-level MCP tools over raw FL API calls. Raw calls are only permitted if no safe wrapper exists.
- When new verified knowledge is acquired, it MUST be documented in a Markdown file. If machine-relevant, it MUST additionally be documented in JSON/YAML.
- Every Knowledgebase entry needs at least: Topic, Source/Verification Method, Date, Confidence Level, Affected API/Function/Tool, Valid Ranges, Example, and Known Pitfalls.
- Hard Rule: Agents MUST NOT leave reusable findings only in chat, commit messages, or temporary scratch notes.

## Knowledge Capture Protocol

An Agent MUST update the Knowledgebase if any of the following occur:
- An FL Studio API behavior is practically tested.
- A parameter range is confirmed (via trial, readback, docs, or error messages).
- A mapping between a UI value and an API value is discovered.
- A recurring error or pitfall is detected.
- A workaround is successfully applied.
- An MCP wrapper is added, modified, or identified as necessary.
- An assumption is proven wrong.
- A tool call or server error shows that existing KB knowledge is missing or unclear.
- A musical recipe rule is reusable.
- A behavior depends on the FL Studio version, platform, plugin version, or API version.

Every new entry MUST contain: Date, Agent/Author, Topic, Affected File/API, Context, Observation, Tested Values, Result, Confidence Level, Source/Method, Reproduction Steps (if relevant), Open Questions, and Next Recommended Action.

Allowed Confidence Levels: `hypothesis`, `user_reported`, `docs_confirmed`, `measured_once`, `measured_repeated`, `implementation_verified`, `cross_platform_verified`, `deprecated_or_rejected`.

Rules:
- If a finding affects tool behavior, Markdown is not enough. JSON/YAML MUST be updated.
- If uncertain, agents MUST NOT document false certainty. Use a low confidence level and add an open question.
- Every new or modified MCP function must check for a KB entry. If none exists, create a brief entry.
- Every resolved false assumption MUST also be documented in `knowledgebase/known_pitfalls/`.

## Do Not Ship As User-Facing Tools

- Plugin loading or insertion.
- Playlist clip editing, placement, movement, or deletion.
- Pattern or clip deletion.
- Project open, new, save-as, or render automation.
- Raw controller/API escape hatches.
- Full FLP snapshot or full-project restore claims.
- Broad UI automation tools.
- Unsafe automation recording tools.

Plugin work should configure already-loaded plugins only. Loading stays manual.

## Documented API Failures

If an officially documented API fails or behaves differently in a live test, do
not immediately discard the capability. Classify it as
`documented-unconfirmed` and run a targeted false-positive probe before
demoting it. The probe must check API presence, target selection/focus,
indexing, readback timing, target/plugin state, and rollback on the current FL
build.

## Implementation Checklist

For every new FL-mutating tool, add or update:

- Protocol command constants, if needed.
- FL controller handler.
- Snapshot scope.
- Restore operation.
- Readback verification.
- Safety-layer integration via the established safety helpers.
- Tool annotations and docstring explaining safety behavior.
- Static audit compatibility.
- Focused script/unit test or rollback-safe live smoke script.
- Roadmap/API audit/docs note when behavior or scope changes.

## Roadmap Discipline

- Treat `ROADMAP.md` as the active execution tracker.
- Keep it current in the same PR or commit series whenever a slice is
  completed, re-scoped, verified, blocked, or reprioritized.
- Record live FL verification checkpoints with date, FL build, controller build
  marker, tested path, and rollback result.

## Commit Discipline

- Use sensible staged commits while working.
- Each commit should be a coherent feature slice or tightly scoped fix.
- Keep commits useful for cherry-picking by sister projects.
- Do not mix unrelated cleanup, formatting, and feature work.
- Commit messages must be English and explain the change clearly.

## Verification Expectations

Run the smallest meaningful checks for the changed area, then broaden when the
blast radius justifies it:

- Compile checks for touched Python code.
- `scripts/audit_tool_safety.py --fail-on-gaps`.
- `scripts/audit_tool_safety.py --fail-on-missing-safety-docs --format json`
  when tool annotations or docstrings change.
- Focused script tests for changed areas.
- FastMCP registration/tool-count checks when tool registration changes.
- Rollback-safe live smoke tests when FL Studio is available and the change
  touches live behavior.

If repo-wide `pytest` or `ruff` failures are pre-existing, report them
separately and do not churn unrelated code.

At handoff, summarize changed files, verification run, remaining risks or API
limits, and the next recommended roadmap slice.

## Local Environment

- Python target: 3.12 for current development on this machine. Package metadata
  still supports Python 3.10+ unless changed deliberately.
- On macOS, commands importing pip, XML, or audio dependencies may need:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/expat/lib:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:-}"
```

- Prefer `rg` and `rg --files` for search.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Do not use destructive Git commands unless explicitly requested.

## Live FL Studio Procedure

- Start the TCP daemon yourself when live tests require it.
- Confirm heartbeat and `fl_transport(action="ping")` before live work.
- Confirm the controller build marker expected by the current code.
- Read current state before writing.
- For live write tests, write a temporary value, verify readback, rollback
  immediately, and verify restoration.
- If MIDI routing, script reload, or restart state is uncertain, diagnose the
  connection before changing code.
- Stop daemons you started and leave playback stopped/recording disarmed after
  tests.
