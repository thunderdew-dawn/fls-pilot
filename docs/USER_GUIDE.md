# User Guide: Value, Prompts, and Tool Reference

This guide explains what fls-pilot is useful for, how a user talks to it
through an AI assistant, and what every exposed MCP tool does.

Most users should ask in plain language. The assistant leverages safety classes, explicit product boundaries, and the current 87-tool public catalog. It proposes a plan when needed, and applies approved changes through the rollback-first safety layer. Users can also name a specific `fl_*` tool directly when they want precise control.

## Why This App Exists

fls-pilot turns FL Studio into a controllable production workspace for any
MCP-compatible AI assistant. Its value is not just remote control; it combines
live FL Studio context, music-production judgement, and reversible edits.

- It lets users ask for production work in natural language: mix diagnosis,
  channel cleanup, routing, plugin tweaks, Piano Roll writing, arrangement
  markers, MIDI export, and audio analysis.
- It gives the assistant real project state instead of screenshots or guesses:
  transport, tempo, channels, mixer tracks, patterns, playlist tracks, routing,
  plugins, plugin parameters, and live meter data.
- It keeps project mutation conservative. Every persistent FL Studio write must
  snapshot the affected state, make the smallest practical change, read back the
  result, log restore data, and support rollback.
- It separates safe automation from FL Studio API limits. Unsupported actions,
  such as loading plugins, rendering audio, deleting patterns, editing playlist
  clips, or broad UI automation, remain manual guidance instead of unsafe tools.

## How Users Interact With The AI

The normal workflow is conversational:

1. The user asks for an outcome, for example "scan my mix and fix the worst
   headroom issue".
2. The assistant reads `fl://agent-briefing`, checks `fl://status`, and uses
   relevant resources such as `fl://mixer`, `fl://channels`, or specific tools.
3. For risky or multi-step work, the assistant explains what it plans to do and
   which changes are reversible.
4. The assistant applies one approved change or one named rollback unit.
5. The assistant reports what changed, what was skipped, and how to roll it
   back.

Users do not need to know tool names, but direct tool names are available for
precision. These are both valid:

```text
Please rename mixer track 8 to Drums and color it blue.
```

```text
Use fl_mixer with action set_name on track 8, then fl_mixer with action set_color on track 8.
```

## Safety Classes

| Safety class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `read-only` | Reads FL Studio, files, or server context without mutating the project. |
| `write-safe` | Mutates FL Studio through the safety layer with snapshot, readback, changelog, and rollback. |
| `transient` | Controls runtime state such as playback or song position; it should not persist in the project. |
| `server-state` | Changes MCP server state, safety history, dry-run mode, or rollback state. |
| `external-write` | Writes outside FL Studio, such as a MIDI file or exported change log. |

## Module Examples

Each example is a user prompt. The assistant may call several tools behind the
scenes, and write tools should be described before execution when the change is
not trivial.

### Transport And Bridge

Prompt:

```text
Check that FL Studio is connected, tell me the tempo, then start playback.
```

Typical tools: `fl_transport(action="ping")`,
`fl_transport(action="get_tempo")`, `fl_transport(action="play")`,
`fl_transport(action="get_play_state")`.

### Project, Mixer, And Channel State

Prompt:

```text
Show me a concise overview of the project, then list tracks that are muted or
too hot.
```

Typical tools: `fl_get_project_state`, `fl_mixer`,
`fl_mixer_get_levels`.

### Channel Organizer And Step Sequencer

Prompt:

```text
Find channels that are not routed to mixer tracks, assign the kick to a free
track, and write a four-on-the-floor kick pattern.
```

Typical tools: `fl_detect_unassigned_channels`,
`fl_assign_channel_to_free_mixer_track`, `fl_channel`.

### Patterns, Playlist, And Arrangement

Prompt:

```text
Create a named intro pattern, clone my main groove for the drop, color the drop
pattern red, and add section markers at bars 1, 17, and 33.
```

Typical tools: `fl_arrange_new_pattern`, `fl_arrange_clone_pattern`,
`fl_pattern`, `fl_arrange_add_marker`.

### Piano Roll And Scale Composition

Prompt:

```text
Write an 8-bar melody in D Dorian to the selected channel, then quantize it to
1/16 notes.
```

Typical tools: `fl_scale_get`, `fl_piano_roll`, or the higher-level
`fl_write_raga_melody`.

### Plugins, Effects, And Mixing Intents

Prompt:

```text
Find the EQ on the lead vocal, reduce harshness around 3 kHz, then show the
before and after parameter values.
```

Typical tools: `fl_plugin`, `fl_apply_eq_intent`.

> **Note on UI Refresh:** When the assistant applies EQ or plugin changes via `fl_apply_eq_intent`, the parameters take effect immediately in the audio engine. However, if the plugin window is currently open in FL Studio, the GUI may not visually update until the user clicks on it or reopens the window.

### Mix Review

Prompt:

```text
Run Mix Review, explain the top three problems, and apply only the safest
headroom fix first.
```

Typical tools: `fl_review_mix`, `fl_review_low_end_stereo`, `fl_gain_stage`,
`fl_apply_mix_adjustment`, `fl_get_change_history`.

### Routing, Bulk Control, And Color

Prompt:

```text
Group all drum tracks into a Drums bus, mute the bass group for comparison,
then undo the mute when I say so.
```

Typical tools: `fl_detect_cleanup_candidates`, `fl_group_tracks`,
`fl_mute_tracks`, `fl_clear_mute_solo`.

### Project Health And Export Readiness

Prompt:

```text
Prepare this project for export: report duplicate names, unrouted channels,
muted tracks, suspicious levels, and give me a dry-run fix plan.
```

Typical tools: `fl_project_health_report`, `fl_export_readiness_report`,
`fl_project_dry_run_fix_plan`.

### Audio Analysis, Presets, Chains, And MIDI Export

Prompt:

```text
Analyze this reference file for tempo and key, suggest a preset from my local
library for a warm bass, then export an 8-bar MIDI sketch.
```

Typical tools: `fl_analyze_audio`, `fl_suggest_preset`,
`fl_setup_chain`, `fl_export_midi`.

## Useful Prompt Patterns

```text
Scan first, do not change anything yet.
```

```text
Show me exactly which tool you will use before you write to FL Studio.
```

```text
Make one reversible change, verify readback, then stop.
```

```text
Use dry-run mode and give me a fix plan only.
```

```text
Rollback the last MCP change.
```

```text
Export the change log so I can audit what was changed.
```

## MCP Resources

Resources are read-only context endpoints the assistant can pull without a
tool call. They are intentionally capped so automatic context reads stay small.

| Resource | What it gives the assistant |
|---|---|
| `fl://agent-briefing` | Compact startup orientation: bridge/status summary, current domain/workflow tools, token strategy, safety rules, and stop rules. |
| `fl://status` | Bridge health, heartbeat age, FL version, tempo, and playback state. |
| `fl://project` | Tempo, transport, and project-level counts. |
| `fl://transport` | Playback, recording, song position, and tempo snapshot. |
| `fl://channels` | Capped Channel Rack summary. |
| `fl://mixer` | Capped mixer-track summary. |
| `fl://patterns` | Capped pattern list. |

## Boundaries To State Clearly To Users

- The app cannot load or insert plugins. Users load plugins manually, then the
  assistant can inspect and configure already-loaded plugins.
- The app does not expose project open, new, save-as, render, pattern deletion,
  playlist clip editing, or raw UI automation tools.
- Piano Roll writes use an armed `MCP_Apply` script and FL undo for rollback;
  structured note readback is still API-limited.
- FL Studio API behavior can be build-dependent. The known-working baseline is
  documented in the README, and live probes should be run before relying on a
  new FL Studio build for write-heavy work.
