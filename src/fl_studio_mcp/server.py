SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
FL Studio MCP server -- control FL Studio from an AI assistant.

REQUIREMENTS
  1. FL Studio 20.7 or newer must be running.
  2. Two virtual MIDI ports must exist (one in each direction):
       - 'FLStudioMCP RX' (server -> FL)
       - 'FLStudioMCP TX' (FL -> server)
     Windows: create both in loopMIDI. macOS: enable two buses in IAC Driver
     (Audio MIDI Setup). Linux: use snd-virmidi.
  3. The FLStudioMCP controller script must be installed under
     Documents/Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Hardware/FLStudioMCP/
  4. In FL Studio: Options > MIDI Settings,
       - Enable 'FLStudioMCP RX' in the Input list, set Controller type to
         FLStudioMCP, give it a Port number (any value, e.g. 42).
       - Enable 'FLStudioMCP TX' in the Output list, set Port to the SAME
         number. This is how FL routes the script's outgoing SysEx back to
         the MCP server.
  5. Call fl_ping first to verify the bridge is healthy.

LIMITS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT (these are FL API limitations, not server bugs)
  - Cannot load new VST/AU plugin instances. You can only control plugins
    that already exist in the project.
  - Cannot create new patterns from scratch. Work with existing patterns,
    or clone via the Piano Roll pyscript.
  - Tempo writes are sometimes ignored if FL is in a modal dialog.

When the user asks for something outside these limits, explain the limit
clearly rather than retrying.
