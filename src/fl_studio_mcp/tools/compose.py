"""Raga / scale composer -- write Claude-generated notes via the note bridge.

NO theory engine: CLAUDE knows the ragas (Hamsadhwani, Charukesi, Mohanam,
Kalyani, ...) and supplies the notes; these tools just SELECT the target channel
and WRITE the notes through the existing (hardened) piano-roll bridge. raga/root
are echoed for labelling only.

Setup (same as the note bridge): Piano roll open + 'MCP_Apply' armed once per
session (Ctrl+Alt+Y target). Writes into the SELECTED pattern + channel.
