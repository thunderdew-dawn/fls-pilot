"""Mixer domain tool — v1.2 Phase 3.

Adds ``fl_mixer`` as a consolidated public domain tool that dispatches
through the operation registry or existing helpers, mirroring the pattern
established by ``fl_transport`` in Slice 05.

Legacy mixer aliases covered by this domain tool are retired from public
registration in the v1.2 compact surface.
